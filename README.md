A simple Python script which recursively searches through a given directory and encodes any videos (with given file extensions) via HandBrakeCLI, replacing old videos and keeping the original file extension.

Using this script can greatly reduce the disk space of a collection of uncompressed or lightly compressed videos in one quick step.

Due to the irreversible nature of this script it is HIGHLY recommended that you backup any directories you plan to use OR that you alter to script so that the old, unencoded videos are not deleted.
